# Spoilern't
A Firefox extesions that blurs out Netfix's description of what you are watching.

## Motivation
While watching Star Trek recently I became annoyed by the fact that when I pause Netflix to allow buffering a description appears and semi-spoils the episode.

## State
This is still very much a built-between-9pm-and-10pm-on-a-Wednesday thing. Things that need to be done include:

- Make it more robust (how?)
- Don't hide descriptions for movies (how?)
- Upload to Mozilla so that it's available for everyone
- Have a keyboard shortcut that shows the synopsis whilst held down?
